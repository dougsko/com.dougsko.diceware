This is the original Diceware application for Android devices. Use this app to create cryptographically secure passphrases that are easy to remember.  

The source code is available at https://github.com/dougsko/com.dougsko.diceware

- Includes 12 different dictionaries.
- Use your own, truly random sequences, produced by real dice.
- Does NOT rely on a pseudorandom number generator (but is able to use one).

Don't have dice? Use the Local PRNG button to generate pseudorandom numbers or hit the Random.org button to use true random numbers generated by atmospheric noise.  This feature is the reason the app needs internet access.
